### Branch Strategy

## Workflow Rules

1. Branch per task: `feature/PROJ-XX-description`
2. PR to main: Requires CI green + 1 reviewer
3. Commit messages: Start with ticket ID, e.g. `PROJ-12: Add ride start logic`

---

## Thin Slice Milestone (First Goal)

CSV Load -> Register User -> Start Ride -> End Ride

1. Load `stations.csv` and `vehicles.csv` into memory
2. `POST /users/register` - stores payment token, returns user_id
3. `POST /rides/start` - picks deterministic eligible vehicle, creates active ride
4. `POST /rides/{id}/end` - docks at nearest station, computes price

## CI Pipeline (Role 1)

GitHub Actions on every PR:
- Install dependencies
- Run linting (ruff/black)
- Run tests (pytest)

---

## Next Steps

1. [x] Create branches
2. [ ] Set up `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
3. [ ] Create project skeleton (`src/`, `tests/`)
4. [ ] Add smoke test
5. [ ] Push to GitHub and verify CI is green
